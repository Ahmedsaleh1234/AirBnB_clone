HTML and CSS Basics
This README provides a brief overview of fundamental concepts related to HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). If you're new to web development, this is a great place to start.

What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard markup language used for creating web pages. HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage through elements and tags.

How to Create an HTML Page
Creating an HTML page is simple. You need a text editor, such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text. Start your document with the following structure:

==Code==
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
--------------------------------------------

What is a Markup Language
A markup language like HTML uses tags to define elements and their structure within a document.

What is the DOM
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page, so programs can change the document structure, content, and style.

What is an Element/Tag
HTML elements or tags are the building blocks of web pages. They define the structure and content of a webpage. Examples include <div>, <p>, and <img>.

What is an Attribute
Attributes provide additional information about an element. For example, the href attribute in an anchor tag (<a>) specifies the link's URL.

How Does the Browser Load a Webpage
When you enter a URL in your browser, it sends a request to a server. The server responds with an HTML document, which the browser interprets and displays.

What is CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, design, and presentation of web content.

How to Add Style to an Element
To add style to an HTML element, use CSS. You can apply styles inline (using the style attribute), internally (in a <style> element in the HTML document), or externally (in a separate CSS file linked to the HTML).

What is a Class
A class in CSS is a way to group elements and apply the same styles to multiple elements. You can define a class using a dot (.) selector in your CSS.

What is a Selector
A selector in CSS is a pattern used to select and style HTML elements. It could be a tag name, class, ID, or more complex selectors.

How to Compute CSS Specificity Value
CSS Specificity determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple conflicting styles exist. It's calculated using a specific value system.

What Are Box Properties in CSS
Box properties in CSS refer to the properties that control the size and spacing of an element's box, such as width, height, margin, padding, and border.
